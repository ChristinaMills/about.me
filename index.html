               <h1> About Me </h1>    
           
               <p class="one">
                I was born in England, at Lakenheath Air Force Base. At age of 2,
                  moved to the US. Living at various Air Force bases. My family settled in Tucson, AZ
                  when I was 6 years old. Tucson is where I grew up and currently live.

               <p> I have spent the last 30 years working in many different forms of retail.I 
                   went to school for Fashion Design and Merchandizing, while working in a grocery
                   store. I have been working in the fashion industry for 20 years, managing my
                   own store for the last 16 years. At the end of 2016, my store closed by the company. 
                   I realised that this was an opportunity to get into a different industry, one that 
                   has a stable and growing future.
